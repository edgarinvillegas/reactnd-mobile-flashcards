# Mobile flashcards

Simple application to autoevaluate using decks of question cards.

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository and use npm/yarn to install.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/edgarinvillegas/reactnd-mobile-flashcards.git
$ cd reactnd-mobile-flashcards
$ yarn
```

## Running

Run it with react-native:

```
$ react-native run-ios
```

Go to your simulator and voil√°, start quizzing!.

Alternativerly, you can use `yarn start` and then `i` to open on iOS simulator.

Note: Currently the app **works only on iOS** due to Mobx 5 dependency.
Making it work on Android is possible, but it needs an `eject` to change js engine natively, which was considered not to be worth it for the app purposes.
